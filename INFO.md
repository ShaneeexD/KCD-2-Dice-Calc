Dice Weight Table

This table shows the weighted sides of the dice as specified in the game files. To get the percentages from the table above you just need to divide the weight of the side you are interested in by the total weight. So for those of you who'd like to get more specific values with more decimals can just use these base values. I just decided to only use one decimal for better readability.
